# Comic Scans

The purpose of this project is to index a manga and make the entirety of its text searchable. It will checkpoint every request to address failure initially

This project is powered by cubari.moe for the images.
The OCR is powered by Surya OCR/EasyOCR models (optional, surya is the default)
(Will be adding more options in the future)

Included an example response to help gauge understanding on how it's to be used
